# 🐦 Flappy Bird Clone using Python & Pygame

A fully functional Flappy Bird clone created using Python and the Pygame library. This version includes a moving background, animated bird sprites, gravity physics, pipe generation, score tracking, and a start + game-over screen.


## 🛠 Features:

✨ Animated bird with smooth wing flapping

🌆 Scrolling background and ground

🚧 Randomly generated top and bottom pipes with collision detection

🧠 Score tracking when pipes are passed

🎮 Start and Game Over screens

🔁 Restart the game with a single key press


## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack:

Language: Python 3

Library: Pygame

Assets: Custom bird, pipe, background, and UI images (e.g. bird_mid.png, pipe_top.png, start.png)


## 🎮 Controls

SPACE: Flap the bird / Start the game

R: Restart the game after a game over

X (top corner): Close the game window


## 🖼️ Assets Used: 
Make sure the following image files are present in the same directory as flappy_bird.py:

1. bird_down.png
2. bird_mid.png
3. bird_up.png
4. background.png
5. ground.png
6. pipe_top.png
7. pipe_bottom.png
8. start.png
9. game_over.png

## 📌 Known Issues / Notes:
1. The game uses fixed screen dimensions (551x720) — resizing isn't supported.
2. Game restarts require pressing R after the game-over screen.
3. Performance might vary slightly depending on system specs and Pygame version.
